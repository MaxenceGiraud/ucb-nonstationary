The main contribution of the paper is the Sliding Window-UCB algorithm, along with the analysis of the latter and Discounted-UCB.\\

Our main critique is that the paper is not always clear.\\
According to them, D-UCB and SW-UCB perform well on changing environments, unlike UCB1. In practice, we confirmed that UCB1 is the best on constant environments, but in abruptly changing environments it is harder to tell.
