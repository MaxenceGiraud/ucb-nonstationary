The setting is the following. TODO

A well-known, efficient algorithm to solve this problem is known as \textit{UCB-1}, and is described in Algorithm \ref{UCB1.}

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{UCB1}
    For t from 1 to $K$, play arm $I_t = t$ \\
    For t from $K$+1 to $T$, play arm 
    $$ I_t = \argmax_{1\leq i \leq K} \bar X_t(i) + c_t(i)$$
\end{algorithm}
