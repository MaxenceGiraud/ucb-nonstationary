In order to deal with the ill-defined SW-UCB, we try $3$ possibilities for this algorithm. Anyway, whether the definition is wrong or not is not a big deal anymore; we find it interesting to explore these $3$ possibilities.

First we choose to work with $\tau > K$. This hypothesis may sound a little arbitrary, however it is coherent in the sense that looking at less time steps than the actual number of arms does not look like a very reliable solution. The exploitation part has to look at several past events in order to be relevant. In that sense we can also say that $\tau$ should be a multiple of $K$, say $5K$ for example. 

Then, with this hypothesis $\tau > K$ we can do something

The first possibility is to
